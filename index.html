    Quality Work by Local Students You Can Trust

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Hey Eastside neighbors! Weâ€™re a small team of college students building something meaningful right here in Redmond, Bellevue, Mercer Island, Kirkland, Woodinville, and Bothell. You might see us on campus during the week, but weekends find us focused on quality work for your home. We believe in doing things right â€“ whether itâ€™s giving your roof and gutters a thorough cleaning, transforming your outdoor space with landscaping or hardscaping, or tackling handyman tasks and light construction projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What drives us?</strong><br/>
      Pride in craftsmanship. We take time with the details because a job well done matters â€“ to you, and to us. Weâ€™re fully licensed and bonded, so you know itâ€™s done safely and professionally, but more importantly, we treat every home like itâ€™s our own. Youâ€™ll work directly with us, the student-owners, so you always know whoâ€™s responsible. Our roots (from Virginia and Tennessee!) instilled a strong work ethic, but our commitment is to your community now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weâ€™re here to help you love your space again.<br/>
      No project is too small for our care and attention. Letâ€™s build something great together â€“ one trusted job at a time.
    </p>
